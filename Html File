<!--To develop a responsive Company Member Team Page using HTML and CSS, I'll provide a step-by-step guide, including a sample code for HTML and CSS. Since I can't view the "designed-1" file, I'll create a general structure for a team page that you can adjust according to the provided design reference.

HTML Structure
First, let's set up the HTML structure for the team page.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Company Member Team Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Our Team</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section class="team-members">
            <div class="member">
                <img src="member1.jpg" alt="Member 1">
                <h2>John Doe</h2>
                <p>CEO</p>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="member">
                <img src="member2.jpg" alt="Member 2">
                <h2>Jane Smith</h2>
                <p>CTO</p>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Add more members as needed -->
        </section>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
<!--Explanation
HTML Structure:

The HTML document starts with a standard <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
The head section includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings, and a link to the external CSS file.
The body section includes a header with the page title and a main section containing team members in a section element.-->
